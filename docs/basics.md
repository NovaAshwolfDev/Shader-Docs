# The Basics
## What is a Shader?
Shaders are programs that run on the GPU and control how objects appear in your scene. 
They are used to create realistic materials, textures, and lighting effects.

## Shader Types
There are two main types of shaders:
- **Vertex shaders** control how vertices are transformed and rendered.
- **Fragment shaders** control how pixels are shaded and blended.
- **Surface shaders** are a combination of vertex and fragment shaders, automatically handling lighting and shadows. Unity uses surface shaders for most materials.
## Shader Properties
Shaders can be configured using properties. These properties are set in the Shader Inspector and affect how the shader behaves.

# Using the Dark Matter Shader

## Setup
1. Import the shader into your Unity project.  
2. Create a new material and select **"Milo/Dark Matter"**.  
3. Assign your **Dark Matter Texture** and **Mask Map**.  
4. Verify your license by going to the shader inspector on the material and clicking **"Verify License"**.
5. Apply it to your object.

## Configuration
- **_Speed:** Controls the global animation rate.  
- **_Scale:** Adjusts texture zoom (higher = smaller pattern).  
- **_Bloom:** Boosts emissive intensity for glowing nebula effects.  
- **_GalaxyParallaxSpeed:** Adds directional scrolling for 3D motion.  
- **_GalaxyParallaxTilingAmount:** Adjusts how tightly parallax textures repeat.  
- **_MaskMap:** Defines which regions glow or remain dark.  
- **_NormalMapScale:** Enhances surface normal depth for lighting response.
